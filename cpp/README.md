# Catan C++

The file ```catan.cpp``` contains a C++ implementation of Catan using LibTorch. Use this code at your own risk: I have not thoroughly tested it. In order to run the code, I followed [this tutorial](https://github.com/ollewelin/Installing-and-Test-PyTorch-C-API-on-Ubuntu-with-GPU-enabled). Note that I could not run it on Windows, and I believe I had to use an older version of LibTorch when running on Ubuntu. Notably, I believe this code should show speedups of up to $ 2 \times $, and I am sure there are further improvements to be found.
